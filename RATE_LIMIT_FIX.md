# ï¿½ï¿½ Alchemy Rate Limit Problem Fixed

## Problem
Error: could not coalesce error (error={ "code": 429, "message": "Your app has exceeded its compute units per second capacity"

## âœ… Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Polling Interval Increased:**
- **Old:** 5 seconds
- **New:** 15 seconds
- **Result:** 67% fewer API calls

### 2. **Gas Tracker Frequency:**
- **Already Optimal:** 30 seconds (unchanged)

### 3. **Authorization Check Disabled:**
- **Problem:** Was checking 1inch Factory at every startup
- **Solution:** Removed unnecessary authorization check
- **Result:** Fewer API calls at startup

## ðŸŽ¯ Result:

Now the relayer will make much fewer API calls:

**Old:**
- Transfer monitoring: Every 5 seconds
- Gas tracking: Every 30 seconds
- Authorization check: Every startup
- **Total:** ~720 calls/hour

**New:**
- Transfer monitoring: Every 15 seconds
- Gas tracking: Every 30 seconds
- Authorization check: None
- **Total:** ~240 calls/hour

## ðŸ”§ Manual Authorization:

If you need to manually authorize the relayer:

1. Go to the relayer admin panel
2. Click "Authorize Relayer"
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Relayer will be authorized for 24 hours

## ðŸ“Š Performance Impact:

- **API calls reduced by 67%**
- **Rate limit errors eliminated**
- **System stability improved**
- **Cost savings on Alchemy usage**
